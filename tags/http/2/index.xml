      <description>I have a Haproxy balancer that routes traffic for multiple projects with different host names and now, I need to enable HTTP/2.0 support for couple or all of them. The problem is that current version of Haproxy not supporting HTTP/2.0 protocol. Also, In my case I have multiple backends. To some of them I need to send http/1.1 traffic and to some of them http/2.0.
The main problem is the mix of tcp/http modes in Haproxy.</description>
